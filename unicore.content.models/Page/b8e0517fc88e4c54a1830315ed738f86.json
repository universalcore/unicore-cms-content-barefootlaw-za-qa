The Law does not prevent children from being employed or working but\r\n    rather prohibits the type of work children can be engaged in. \r\n\r\n 3. Children below 12 years old cannot be employed. However, the law\r\n    allows children between 12-14 years to do light work. Children below\r\n    16 years cannot do work underground, such as mining, or dangerous\r\n    work that is harmful to their health. \r\n\r\n 4. It is unlawful to employ children to work anytime between 7pm to 7am.\r\n\r\n[Cases][1]\r\n\r\n[Take Action!][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/0d62e8a07d1244b897eb6941c78cc808/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/711dced5c715458ba8a369a71fc25eed/",
