  "content": "BarefootLaw is a self-funded, volunteer run social enterprise that\u2019s at the forefront of providing free legal information and support in Uganda. We are actively using/ leveraging technology especially information technology - to deliver free legal information to the Ugandan public and have registered great success over our three years of activity.\r\n\r\n The Internet is the backbone of our operation. Our core methods of delivering this information/ \r\nlegal support are based on synthesising available technology and the law, to maximize the delivery of critical legal information across all possible platforms. \r\n\r\nOur spectrum of platforms for access range from mobile apps to basic feature phone Short Messaging Services (SMS), to the more traditional telephone and radio and as a result we have been able to develop a model that caters to as wide and as diverse a populace as we possibly can. The impact has been commendable, with our activities reaching more than 300,000 individuals every month, and over 150 unique direct interactions with individuals daily. This impact is only a start to getting to our vision. \r\n\r\nOur vision is to create an information ecosystem where any and every individual can access legal information through any and every medium available to them. We\u2019ve started out in Uganda, but our growth plan for the medium to long term is to make this a continent wide system \u2013 possibly worldwide.\r\n\r\nMore information about BarefootLaw can be found here:\r\n\r\n[www.facebook.com/barefootlaw][1]\r\n\r\n[www.barefootlaw.org][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.facebook.com/barefootlaw\r\n  [2]: http://www.barefootlaw.org",
