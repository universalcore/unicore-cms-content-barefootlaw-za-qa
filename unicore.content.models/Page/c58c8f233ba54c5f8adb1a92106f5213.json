  "content": "Uganda is one of the few countries around the world that have outlawed Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). Female genital mutilation is practiced by 1% of Uganda\u2019s population namely the Sabiny, Pokot, Tepetha and Kadam. Among the Pokot, FGM/C is nearly universal at 95 per cent (95%) and is 50 per cent (50%) among the Sabiny. Up to 134,000 women are affected.  \r\n\r\nIn 2010, the Government came up with a law called the Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation Act which prohibited this practice and provides for a punishment of imprisonment of up to 10 years for those involved in it.\r\n\r\nThe practice therefore by members of the community who wish to carry out FGM is unlawful and could get them imprisoned for up to 10 years.\r\n\r\n[Cases][1]\r\n\r\n[Take Action!][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/32402c4906644aa7a9523441acda738f/\r\n  [2]: http://iogt.qa-hub.unicore.io/page/e3c3d13e71d44acdb8e385955a025860/",
